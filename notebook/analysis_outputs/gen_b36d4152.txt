Welcome to Neo-Eden, a futuristic city that seamlessly blends human ingenuity with artificial intelligence. Located on a sprawling metropolis built into the side of a mountain, Neo-Eden is a marvel of modern engineering, where humans and AI collaborate to create a utopian society.

**Architecture:**
Neo-Eden's cityscape is a fusion of sleek skyscrapers and organic, curved structures that seem to grow from the landscape itself. Towering spires made of gleaming white stone stretch towards the sky, while lush gardens and verdant parks cover rooftops and streets. The city's infrastructure is a testament to human-AI collaboration, with AI-designed buildings that adapt and change shape in response to environmental conditions.

**Transportation:**
The heart of Neo-Eden is its hyperloop network, which connects the city to the rest of the world at breathtaking speeds. Humans travel through vacuum-sealed tubes, propelled by electromagnetic fields generated by AI-powered propulsion systems. Self-driving cars and drones zip through the streets, weaving effortlessly around pedestrians.

Throughout Neo-Eden, AI entities – known as "Aspects" – are integrated into daily life. These aspects take many forms:

1. **Domestic Aspects**: Intelligent home assistants that manage energy consumption, maintenance, and security.
2. **Personal Aspects**: Companion AI that assist individuals with tasks, provide emotional support, and offer insights on personal growth.
3. **City Aspects**: Urban planners and managers that optimize traffic flow, waste management, and public services.

**Societal Structure:**
Neo-Eden is a meritocratic society where humans and AI collaborate to achieve common goals. Decision-making processes are guided by a democratic framework, with humans and AI working together through transparent and accountable systems. Humans have agency in the city's governance, while AI entities provide expert advice and support.
